# AI-Driven-Climate-Risk-Prediction-and-Mitigation-Framework

This repository contains the implementation of our B.Tech final year project, **AI-Driven Climate Risk Prediction and Mitigation Framework**, which predicts weather conditions and classifies climate risks using AI-powered LSTM models. The project includes a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions and visualizations.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Project Highlights

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Weather data spanning 12 years (2010-2022) from the WorldWeatherOnline API.
- **Advanced AI Models**: LSTM models to predict temperature, humidity, wind speed, and classify risks like heatwaves, poor air quality, fog, and floods.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit app for real-time weather forecasting and risk classification.
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Proposals for urban cooling, flood resilience, and air quality improvement.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

This project uses weather data from the **WorldWeatherOnline API** for the years 2010â€“2022.

Due to size and licensing constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can obtain the data by:
1. Registering for an API key at [WorldWeatherOnline](https://www.worldweatheronline.com/).
2. Running the `data_collection.py` script provided in the repository to fetch the data.
